# Summary

This was a good challenege to understand incremeting. I looked through a lot of documentation to try and find why it would not initially increment and found out that the ++ can becalled ahead of the variable as well as after so that it could be accomplished in a single line.

Switch statements are also still challenging for me. While I understood the cases that I was trying to evaluate to get the result I was initially unsure of the expression the switch statement was looking for. I eventually found options where it could be true false and since the expressions would be truthy or falsey I was looking for a truthy soution as the switch statement was executed.

Also, some more CSS understaning with being able to both consolodate formatting for multiple classes in a sincle statment while also looking into HTML divs to adjust specific components was very helpful to understand a bit better.
